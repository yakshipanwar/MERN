            <h3>About me</h3>
            <p>
            I'm a passionate and curious full-stack web developer with a strong foundation in Python, JavaScript, and the Django framework. What started as a casual curiosity about how websites work soon turned into a deep interest in building responsive, user-friendly, and impactful web applications. From sketching out ideas on paper to bringing them to life through code, I enjoy every part of the creative and technical journey.

            Currently pursuing my degree in Computer Science, I spend most of my time learning, experimenting, and developing projects that solve real-world problems. Whether it’s a student management system, a weather application using APIs, or a dynamic blog app — I love diving into problems and figuring out efficient, clean, and scalable solutions. I’m also continuously exploring new tools and technologies to stay updated with the fast-evolving tech world.

            Beyond technical skills, I strongly value collaboration, creativity, and clear communication. I believe that great software is not just about writing good code — it's also about understanding people’s needs, designing with empathy, and creating something that truly adds value.
